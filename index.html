      <h1>Dear Mom,</h1>
      <p>
        I would never be the person I am today without you. You have led me through every step in life always providing me the support I needed and helped me push myself when I needed to. You are genuinely the kindest person on this planet and you bring so much love to everyone who meets you. You mean more than everything to me. People always say that their mom is the best, but you are truly the best mom on this planet. You were born to be the perfect mom. I can see it whenever you see a puppy, kitten, or someone else's baby — you immediately step into mom mode and I instantly know how lucky I am at those points. I love you with all my heart and I cannot stress enough how lucky I am to call you my mom.
        <br><br>
        When I was at my worst with my head problems you got me through every day. I was so sad at some points — literally crying in a ball hiding in the corner — and you would always find me and make me feel better. You would push me to keep fighting and to heal. I would never have gotten through that without you.
        <br><br>
        Whenever I am at my highest you are always my biggest supporter and you always make me feel so loved and special. I can also tell how much all of your friends love you every time I meet them. They all talk the highest of you — but I can also see they see you as a card shark who is no one to take lightly in the card room.
        <br><br>
        I hope you have the most amazing day because it’s your special day.
        <strong>HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOM!</strong> I love you so much and hope this is an awesome sauce day.
      </p>
